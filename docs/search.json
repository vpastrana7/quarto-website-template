My project specifically includes looking at the transit of these nanobubbles and analyzing their movement in order to predict drug distribution and potential efficacy of chemotherapeutics when looking at tumor models in mice.\nIn addition to my research, I entertain myself with various hobbies. I enjoy cooking new meals, hiking, running and playing/watching football (soccer). As you explore my website, I am sure you will see examples of all of these things!\n\nMy Github Page!"

    "text": "Nanobubbles are lipid shell based nanoparticles that are able to expand and contract in response to an acoustic field. The field, in this case, comes from the ultrasound transducer. Due to their special movements, they are bright and able to be seen on ultrasound images. Their small size does not allow for individual observation, but together they act as an echogenic fluid! This way we hope to gain more insight into the structures of tumors and the potential efficacy of different chemotherapeutics."

Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
