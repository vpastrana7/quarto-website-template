Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My project specifically includes looking at the transit of these nanobubbles and analyzing their movement in order to predict drug distribution and potential efficacy of chemotherapeutics when looking at tumor models in mice.\nIn addition to my research, I entertain myself with various hobbies. I enjoy cooking new meals, hiking, running and playing/watching football (soccer). As you explore my website, I am sure you will see examples of all of these things!\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
