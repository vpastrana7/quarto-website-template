# Welcome to my website!

I am Victor Pastrana-GÃ³mez, a current student in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Case Western Reserve University. 

My current research includes ultrasound imaging and the use of lipid based nanobubbles as contrast for use within ultrasound imaging. My project specifically includes looking at the transit of these nanobubbles and analyzing their movement in order to predict drug distribution and potential efficacy of chemotherapeutics when looking at tumor models in mice. 

In addition to my research, I entertain myself with various hobbies. I enjoy cooking new meals, hiking, running and playing/watching football (soccer). As you explore my website, I am sure you will see examples of all of these things!
